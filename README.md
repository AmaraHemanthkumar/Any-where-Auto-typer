# Any-where-auto-typer
Any where auto typer is a python code which can able to type automaticaly . You can run code  and click the mouse pointer where you want to type ,thats it . This will be usefull where copy paste is blocked ,so you have to type insted you can  use this python code. No extention can detect it . And some times copy paste is available with use some extentions  but they can be detected. so using this auto typer is much better idea than any other technic.


###### Process to follow ######

Before running the code for the first time ,you need to run  this command in the command prompt i.e " pip install pynput " .
Next you need to make a file and add the matter that what you want to auto type .
Now copy the file path 
Run the code it will give some instruction to follw while auto typing and also ask you to type the location of the file ,paste the copied path their.
Now  click the mouse pointer where you want to wait you just need to wait 20 seconds to start the auto typing.

Don't interfear while auto typing 
Auto typing in the code compilers gives you some extra brackets in the end because it is compiler features to type 2 brackets at once (open bracket and closed bracket).
So in the end you need to remove those brackets .
