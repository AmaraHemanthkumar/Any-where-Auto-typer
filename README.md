This will be useful where copy paste is blocked . So you have to type , buy instead you can  use this python code. No extension can detect it . And some times copy paste is available with use some extensions , but they can be detected. Using this auto typer is much better idea than any other technic.

###### Process to follow ######

1 . Before running the code for the first time ,you need to run  this command in the command prompt i.e " pip install pynput " .

2 . Next you need to make a file and add the matter that what you want to auto type .

3 . Now copy the file path .

4 . Run the code it will give some instruction to follow while auto typing and also ask you to type the location of the file ,paste the copied path their.

5 . Now  click the mouse pointer where you want to wait you just need to wait 20 seconds to start the auto typing.

##### RULES #####

1 . Don't interfere while auto typing .

2 . Auto typing in the code compilers gives you some extra brackets in the end because it is compiler features to type 2 brackets at once (open bracket and closed bracket).
